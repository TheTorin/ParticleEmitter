This code is not meant to work on its own. The full solution has many dependencies and other files that were not written by me. Notably, a Matrix and Vector class. However, the point of this is not to have a project that runs.

This is simply posting code that I worked on in school to show off as part of my portfolio. All C++ code here is stuff that I have written. The teachers assisted with bugs and in working with OpenGL, but still had me write it myself.
